 This Windows Forms application in C# allows users to download YouTube videos as MP3 files. Users can enter a YouTube URL, and upon clicking the download button, the app uses YoutubeExplode to fetch and download the video. A progress bar updates in real-time, showing the download progress. After downloading, the app converts the video to MP3 using MediaToolkit. Users choose the save location for the MP3 file via a SaveFileDialog. A completion notification pops up once the process is complete. This app provides a user-friendly way to convert YouTube videos into MP3s directly from the desktop.
